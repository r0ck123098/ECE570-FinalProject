# ECE570-FinalProject

For the model that I trained, you need to download it from the google drive.
this is the google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/147NJfxJCJ7RkCEabP-zTO7GlbTitVMzt?usp=sharing
Important: remember to unzip the file and match the relative location in the code.
Also, if you wish to train by yourself instead of loading, uncomment the trainer.train() function so that you can have your own model (not recommended, it usually takes around 1 hr to 5 hrs)
